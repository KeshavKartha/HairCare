                <p class="para_left">It's important to note that while our prediction suggests that you may not experience hair loss during chemotherapy, it's essential to remember that our machine learning model is not infallible. There is still a possibility that you may experience hair loss despite the prediction.
                    <br><br>
                    However, we encourage you to maintain a positive mindset and not let the potential for hair loss affect your well-being. Hair loss is a temporary side effect of chemotherapy, and many individuals find strength and resilience in embracing their changing appearance. Remember that your worth and beauty extend far beyond your physical appearance.
                    <br><br>
                    In the event that hair loss does occur, we are here to support you every step of the way. Our website provides resources, guidance, and a community forum where you can find encouragement, tips, and personal experiences shared by others who have gone through similar challenges.
                    <br><br>
                    Regardless of the outcome, focus on your overall health and well-being during this journey. Surround yourself with a supportive network of loved ones and healthcare professionals who can provide the emotional support you need. Together, we can navigate the impact of cancer treatment with strength and positivity.</p>
